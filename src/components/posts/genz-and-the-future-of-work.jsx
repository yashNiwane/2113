They experienced firsthand the fragility of traditional work structures and witnessed the rise of remote work and flexible schedules.  The pandemic highlighted the importance of mental health and well-being, further solidifying these priorities for Gen Z."},

{type: "subheading", text: "Inheriting a World in Flux"},

{type: "paragraph", text: "Gen Z is inheriting a world grappling with climate change, economic uncertainty, and social unrest.
